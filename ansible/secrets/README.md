# Deployment and Site Secrets
This directory contains all secrets (passwords, API Keys, etc.) needed for
provisioning and deployment.

The secret files are distributed independently, please ask one of the site
maintainers if you need to get access to those.

You can find a template of how the secrets files should look in
`../secrets.dist`.

In particular, the following file types are present:
- All `.secrets.yml` are encrypted using Ansible Vault and require a password.
  An exception is the `dev-vagrant.secrets.yml` file, which is not
  encrypted and not shared.
- All `*-sshkeys.secrets.yml` files contain SSH key material for the
  corresponding environment.

## Editing Ansible Vault files
~~~
ansible-vault edit FILE.secrets.yml
~~~

For more information, see http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html

## Creating SSH Keys
To regenerate the SSH keys, run

~~~
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -f staging_key -C stage.librecores.org
~~~

and write the outputs of `staging_key{.pub}` into the vault file.
